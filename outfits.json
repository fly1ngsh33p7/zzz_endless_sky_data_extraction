Upon firing, all the heat is forced into the firing chamber using an inordinately strong heat pump, resulting in a thermally ionized plasma that is compressed into bolts and then discharged, dumping all of the heat from the Casparna's internals onto the first target it hits. The temperatures achieved by the projectiles are so hot that it can cause metals such as titanium to melt as if they were butter, and the heat can even cause premature burnoff in an enemy ship's fuel tanks.\n\nThe downside of relying on the ship's heat systems to power the main cannon is that, if the ship is too cold, the gun will fail to fire, and this system also doubles as the primary heat expulsion method of the ship.",

When dispensed from a fast-moving platform like a Lightning Bug, it becomes a very effective crowd-control tool.\n\n\tThe Charge Gas storage, containment, and deployment network has some curious properties as well. In particular, stored charge gas can act as a reserve ion sink; a small amount of gas can't noticeably dissipate much, but a full tank will quickly absorb any ionization affecting a ship.

Though the ammunition stores burn down much faster than a human Gatling gun, the weapon still remains extremely effective.\n\n\tWhile the weapon's cooldown period is staunchly reduced due to the cooling loop, it still eventually dumps all of its heat back into the parent ship.",

This region, more than any building or ship, is the Remnant laboratory where they study the deepest workings of the universe.\n\n\tWhen asked to clarify whether the name refers to either ripping or crying, the technician looks at you with a curious expression, and replies 'both.' They then go on to explain that a very simplistic explanation for this weapon is that it is making micro-tears in the fabric of space-time, then cauterizing them together again. Should not the Ember Wastes cry at the necessity of such weapons?\n\n\tThese massive weapons require special hardpoints, and are built in such few number that the Remnant distribute them directly on an as-needed basis.

This region, more than any building or ship, is the Remnant laboratory where they study the deepest workings of the universe.\n\n\tWhen asked to clarify whether the name refers to either ripping or crying, the technician looks at you with a curious expression, and replies 'both.' They then go on to explain that a very simplistic explanation for this weapon is that it is making micro-tears in the fabric of space-time, then cauterizing them together again. Should not the Ember Wastes cry at the necessity of such weapons?\n\n\tThese massive weapons require special hardpoints, and are built in such few number that the Remnant distribute them directly on an as-needed basis.

The missiles are fired in volleys of six at a time from each launcher, making them very effective at overwhelming point defenses despite their fragility. However, the low amount of fuel they carry means they can only home in on the target for about a second before they turn into unguided ammunition. Because they are manufactured on the spot, it takes a long time to reload.",

This region, more than any building or ship, is the Remnant laboratory where they study the deepest workings of the universe.\n\n\tWhen asked to clarify whether the name refers to either ripping or crying, the technician looks at you with a curious expression, and replies 'both.' They then go on to explain that a very simplistic explanation for this weapon is that it is making micro-tears in the fabric of space-time, then cauterizing them together again. Should not the Ember Wastes cry at the necessity of such weapons?\n\n\tThese massive weapons require special hardpoints, and are built in such few number that the Remnant distribute them directly on an as-needed basis.

The Empire military scientics also improved the weapon accuracy, that was very bad for the old Plasma guns.\n\n\tDerived from the original Plasma Repeater, this heavier version trades off its larger bursts for a much faster rate of fire.

Instead of letting their effort go to waste, they instead opted to put their newfound knowledge to use creating a weapon suitable for their more nimble craft.

The weapon's origins lie in giant reactors that were constructed to pull asteroids out of their home planet's orbit, providing easy access to more resources. Naturally, a mechanism to slow the asteroids down was also implemented to prevent accidental asteroid strikes.\n\n\tAs the Incipias' mastery of spaceflight grew, so did the generators' efficiency, which allowed for more compact, ship-based tractor beams. Resource collection was greatly streamlined by these new models, much to the benefit of the Incipias' otherwise sluggish ships.\n\n\tThe secret of how these beams work is only known to a few scientists of the Incipias who are under the control of the state. Such knowledge, if made public, could have disastrous consequences for the Hicemus and their grip on power.",

      "description": "The Remnant live in an environment where the raw materials for fuel are relatively common on the winds of the nebula. As such, their ships incorporate significant built-in ramscoop technology, and while they are reluctant to waste fuel, they aren't afraid of using it when needed. Far more important is the ability for their ships to quickly and efficiently enter or exit combat as needed. At the end of the day, it is continued life that is paramount.\n\n\tThe Bellows-Class Afterburner embodies this philosophy by providing captains with a tool that allows them to make great leaps of acceleration, typically during evasive maneuvers or to catch up with a fleeing target. Due to their enormous fuel usage, only the most specialized of ships have enough fuel to use these for more than a few seconds at a time before completely running out of fuel.",

These include a hyperdrive, an enormous fusion reactor, and the most powerful plasma engines you've ever seen. It's all examples of relatively simple technology, but they have been refined and taken to their extreme. The engines are fundamentally connected to the fusion reactor, increasing their thrust even further and thereby allowing the Emerald Sword to fly at impressive speeds, traveling through interstellar space with relative ease.",

Far more important is the ability for their ships to quickly and efficiently enter or exit combat as needed. At the end of the day, it is continued life that is paramount.\n\n\tThe Bellows-Class Afterburner embodies this philosophy by providing captains with a tool that allows them to make great leaps of acceleration, typically during evasive maneuvers or to catch up with a fleeing target. Due to their enormous fuel usage, only the most specialized of ships have enough fuel to use these for more than a few seconds at a time before completely running out of fuel.",
